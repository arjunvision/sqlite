1. Project Setup:

Create an Android Studio project: If you don't have one already, launch Android Studio and create a new project. Choose a suitable name and target SDK version.
Initialize Git repository: Within your project directory, open a terminal and run git init. This initializes an empty Git repository in your project.
2. Code Structure:

Separate code for data access: Create a dedicated package or class for your SQLite code. This helps maintain separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage data access logic.
SQLiteOpenHelper subclass: Extend the SQLiteOpenHelper class to create and manage your database. This class provides methods for database creation, version management, and upgrades.
3. SQLite Database Implementation:

Database definition: Define the structure of your database using SQL statements within your SQLiteOpenHelper subclass. This includes creating tables, specifying columns and their data types, and defining constraints if needed.
CRUD operations: Implement methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in your database. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. Sharing with Git:
